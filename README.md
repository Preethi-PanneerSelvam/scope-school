Sure, here's a simple README file for your code:

# School Examination System

This is a basic Python program that simulates a school examination system where students answer questions, and teachers grade them. It consists of three classes: `school`, `teacher`, and `student`, each serving a specific role in the examination process.

## Usage

### `school` class

The `school` class is responsible for managing questions and answers. Here's how to use it:

1. Create an instance of the `school` class by providing a list of questions:

```python
Velammal = school(['What is Python', 'What is DS'])
```

2. Retrieve student answers and store them in the `school` instance using the `get_answer` method:

```python
Velammal.get_answer(Preethi.answer)
```

3. Calculate corrections and store them in a dictionary using the `corrections` method:

```python
Velammal.corrections()
```

4. Access the corrected answers in the `final` attribute:

```python
Velammal.final
```

### `teacher` class

The `teacher` class is responsible for grading and marking student responses. Here's how to use it:

1. Create an instance of the `teacher` class:

```python
Vaishu = teacher()
```

2. Grade the student responses using the `corrections` method by providing the corrected answers and questions:

```python
Vaishu.corrections(Velammal.final, Velammal.questions)
```

3. Access the final marks in the `final_mark` attribute:

```python
Vaishu.final_mark
```

### `student` class

The `student` class allows students to answer the questions. Here's how to use it:

1. Create an instance of the `student` class:

```python
Preethi = student()
```

2. Start the exam by providing the list of questions to the `start_exam` method:

```python
Preethi.start_exam(Velammal.questions)
```

3. Input your answers for each question when prompted.

4. The answers will be stored in the `answer` attribute of the `student` instance.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use these classes together:

```python
Velammal = school(['What is Python', 'What is DS'])
Preethi = student()
Vaishu = teacher()

Preethi.start_exam(Velammal.questions)
Velammal.get_answer(Preethi.answer)
Velammal.corrections()

# Access corrected answers
print(Velammal.final)

Vaishu.corrections(Velammal.final, Velammal.questions)

# Access final marks
print(Vaishu.final_mark)
```

## Note

This is a basic implementation for educational purposes. In a real-world scenario, you may want to consider additional features such as error handling, data persistence, and more comprehensive grading logic.
